## 👋 About

I am a Software Engineer and M.S. Computer Science (AI/ML) student at Duke University, focused on building **production-grade, AI-powered systems** with **end-to-end ownership**. My work sits at the intersection of **agentic software architectures, distributed backends, and developer-facing tooling**, where correctness, performance, and reliability matter as much as model capability.

I am the **sole founder and engineer of VYNN AI**, an agentic financial analyst platform built entirely end-to-end, spanning backend services, multi-agent orchestration, real-time market data pipelines, and LLM-driven analysis to deliver actionable investment insights in production. Previously, I designed and built **AutoCodeRover**, an LLM-based autonomous code repair system acquired by SonarSource, integrating agentic reasoning directly into the IDE workflow. Across research and industry, I focus on turning AI ideas into **scalable, observable, and maintainable software systems**.

## 🚀 Selected Work

### **VYNN AI** — Agentic Financial Analyst Platform  
🔗 https://vynnai.com  
**Founder & Sole Engineer**

- Built and deployed a full-stack, production agentic system for financial analysis and valuation with **end-to-end ownership**
- Designed multi-agent orchestration using LangGraph and tool-augmented reasoning, enabling autonomous analysis, Self-RAG, and structured report generation
- Implemented **distributed, async backends** (FastAPI, Redis, MongoDB) with real-time **SSE/WebSocket streaming**
- Deployed containerized services on cloud infrastructure using Docker and Caddy, supporting CI/CD, persistent storage, and fault tolerance
- Optimized parallel execution and result caching, **reducing end-to-end latency by 72%** in production

### **SonarSource (AutoCodeRover)** — IDE-Integrated Autonomous Program Repair  
🔗 https://www.sonarsource.com/company/press-releases/sonar-acquires-autocoderover-to-supercharge-developers-with-ai-agents/  
**Software Engineer**

- Improved autonomous code repair performance to **46% SWE-bench Verified** and **37% Lite** through algorithmic and systems-level enhancements
- Built a **JetBrains IDE plugin in Kotlin**, integrating with Sonar tooling for real-time diagnostics and autonomous repair
- Designed **AST-level Patch Alignment** using GumTree to reconcile LLM-generated patches with live developer edits
- Implemented a **Self-Repair Agent** with feedback-driven replay loops and structured state tracking
- Reduced manual debugging effort by ~**40%** through IDE-native agentic workflows

---

### **Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Systematic Reviews** — NUS UROP  
**AI Researcher**

- Built a scalable multi-agent framework for large-scale citation screening and text mining
- Evaluated across **150K+ abstracts** from 15 systematic reviews
- Achieved **99.5% sensitivity** and **87.9% specificity**, with **99.95% NPV**, relative to manual screening baselines
- Primary contributor to manuscript under review at **NEJM AI (2025)**
